I am a Master in Physics with a specialization in data analysis, modeling, and machine learning. My academic background, combined with my professional experience, has equipped me with the skills necessary to work with large datasets, derive meaningful insights, and develop predictive models using advanced algorithms.

My interests extend beyond technical domains to include a deep curiosity about history, economics, linguistics and games. I enjoy combining these fields with technology to create something useful, artistic, or simply fun.

Currently, I am expanding my knowledge in artificial intelligence and LLMs with the goal of integrating it into my future projects and initiatives. I am passionate about harnessing the potential of AI to enhance problem-solving across multiple fields and make out lives better.


[comment]: <> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[comment]: <> Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[comment]: <> Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
